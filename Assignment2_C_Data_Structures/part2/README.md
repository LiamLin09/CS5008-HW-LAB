# Building Data Structures - Stack
<img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Lifo_stack.png/350px-Lifo_stack.png" alt="Stack picture">

A 'stack' data structure is analogous to how you might wash dishes at a restaurant. A dirty dish is placed near the sink, and you pick it up to begin washing it. As customers bring in more dirty dishes, they are stacked on top of each other. With this ordering, the newest dirty-dish is placed on the top. This makes a stack a  'last-in first-out' (LIFO) data structure. Thus stacks have a strict policy about how information is stored and accessed.

For this assignment, you are going to implement a specific implementation of a stack using a linked list in the **mystack.h** file.

## Part 1 - Stack implementation as a linked list.

Our stack has two fundamental operations that it can perform:

1. push - Add elements to the top of the stack.
2. pop  - Remove elements from the top of the stack.

You will notice, both of these operations happen at *the top of the stack*. Sometimes, we also refer to these operations as 'enqueue' or 'dequeue' so we have a consistent langauge for our data structures.

Our stack that we are implementing can expand dynamically, thus a linked list is a good foundational data struturre to use in our implementation.

Our stack can push elements onto it, until `MAX_DEPTH` is reached. MAX_DEPTH is defined as 32 for our implementation. For our implementation, we are artificially setting this limit. Remember however, we only have a finite amount of memory on our systems, so if we had very large stacks, we could get a [stack overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow).

For more information on the stack, can be seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)

**Your task** will be to implement the functions in the mystack.h to have a working implementation of stack.

## Part 2 - What is a file that ends in .h.

A file that ends in .h is known as a header file. A header file typically is a file that contains an 'interface' for a set of functions to perform some task. The actual implementation (i.e. the loops, if-statements, arrays, and tools that do work) are found in a .c file. 

For this assignment, our 'stack' library is quite small, so we will implement the entire functionality into a header file. There are some pros and cons to this approach. One particular 'pro' is it makes your code very easy to test. We will simply use our own 'main.c' file to test your implementation (that is why it is important you do not change the names of any functions).

## Part 3 - Why is a stack a useful data structure?

We are going to talk about stacks quite a lot in this course, so it will be important to understand them. Do a little outside research, and edit this section of the readme answering specifically: Why is a stack useful and/or when should it be used?

# TODO: Put your answer here

a stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follow the LIFO order. after some research, stack is usedul in various scenarios and can be employed for the following purposes:
1. stacks can be used to parse mathematical expreesions, HTML, XML, and other structured data formats. when parsing, you can use a stack to keep track of nested elements or operators.
2. in some programming languages, a stack is used for managing memory allocation for local variables, while a heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. this ensures eddicient memory management and deallocarion.
3. stacks can be used to evaluate post-fix or reverse Polish notation expressions. you can push operands onto the stack and perform operations when operators are encountered.
4. in software development, a stack can be used to manage dependencies when building or deploying applicarions. each dependency can be pushed onto the stack, and they are installed or resoloved in the order they are popped.
5. web browsers use stacks to implement nevigation history. when you visit a new page, it is pushed onto the history stack. you can navigate backward and forward by popping items from the stack.
6. stacks can be used in task management systems to track tasks and their dependencies. tasks can be pushed onto the stack as they are scheduled and popped when they are completed.
7. various algo, such as DFS and some recursive algo, can be implemented using stacks to keep track of visited nodes or recursive function calls.


# Unit Tests

A unit test is a standalone test that checks for the correctness of a specific use case in your code. In our case, we are testing if we have a working stack implementation. A sample unit tests is given:

```cpp
void unitTest1(){
	stack_t* test1 = create_stack(MAX_DEPTH);
	printf("Attempting to add %d\n",1);
	stack_enqueue(test1,1);	
	printf("Removing: %d\n",stack_dequeue(test1));	

	free_stack(test1);
}
```

You *may* also consider writing some unit tests to test your implementation (In fact, I would strongly encourage you to do so). Note that you can include your unit tests in your submission, and we will have our own test suite. Some example tests we might come up with include:

* Fill a stack, empty the stack, and fill the stack again.
* Create an empty stack and pop an item to add something to it.
* etc.

## Provided Tests

You are provided a file called queue_test.c which you can compile separately and test your implementation of your queue functions from your header file. Doing so does not guareentee a perfect assignment, but it will give you some confidence your implementation is working.

* Compile: `gcc stack_test.c -o stack_test`
* Run: `./stack_test`

# Rubric

- 40% Correct Stack implementation
  - All functions should be implemented. Do not rename the functions, but you may add any 'helper' functions if you deem necessary.
    - (e.g. You might have a 'stack_print' to help you debug)
  - There should be no memory leaks
  - There should be no bugs in your functions 
  - Your implementation will be graded by our set of unit tests, and we will check your code 'style' as well.
- 10% Correct writeup on the importance of stacks.
  - I expect this to be in the range of 2-3 paragraphs (Can include complexity, example usage, pros/cons, etc).

# Going Further
(An optional task to extend this assignment--not for bonus, but just for fun)

* Add additional functions like:
  * stack_peek - Returns the top value of the stack (without removing it)
  * stack_equals - Checks if two stacks are equal
