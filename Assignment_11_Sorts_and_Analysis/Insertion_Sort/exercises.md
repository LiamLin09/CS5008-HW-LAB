# Exercises

Discuss and answer the following questions (Please make sure to elaborate and justify your responses):

1. Explain what do you think the Big-Oh (worst-case) complexity of this algorithm is? Why?
2. What do you think the best-case complexity of this algorithm is?
   - Provide an example of an array of elements that fit the best-case.
3. Does insertion sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? Explain why or why not.
4. What is a 'stable sorting' algorithm? Is insertion sort a 'stable' algorithm, why or why not?

## Answers:

1. *edit your answer here for question 1*
The Big-Oh (worst-case) complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(n^2). This is because in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm would have to compare each element to every other element in the array, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

2. *edit your answer here for question 2*
The best-case complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(n). This is because in the best-case scenario, the algorithm would only have to compare each element to the element before it, resulting in linear time complexity.

3. *edit your answer here for question 3*
Insertion sort does not require any additional storage beyond the original array. This is because the algorithm sorts the array in-place, meaning that it does not require any additional storage.

4. *edit your answer here for question 4*
A 'stable sorting' algorithm is an algorithm that preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys. Insertion sort is a 'stable' algorithm because it preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys.
