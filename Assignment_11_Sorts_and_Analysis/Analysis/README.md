# Primer on Proofs

For this assignment we are going to continue our analysis of algorithms and continue to reinforce some of the techniques that we have learned.

This assignment will be a *written* assignment, and will not involve any C code. You will annotate the provided [CS5008_HW11_Analysis.pdf](./CS5008_HW11_Analysis.pdf) and upload your own copy of this .pdf in the zip file for the submission for Assignment 11 on the handin server along with your implementation of insertion and selection sort (please name it the same name). 

You are also welcome to print out the assignment and write in your solutions, and take a picture of the assignment and convert it to a .pdf after.

If you have trouble uploading, please let us know on piazza. 

Note: For students who go on to take CS 5800, you may be using using LaTeX to write your solutions, so you are welcome to practice in this course though not required at this time to do so for written assignments.

# Deliverable

- Please upload an annotated [CS5008_HW11_Analysis.pdf](./CS5008_HW11_Analysis.pdf) with your solutions.

# Rubric

- Each problem is weighted equally, totaling 100%.

# (Optional) Going Further Task:

(This is an ungraded task--only work on this if you finish the deliverable). You will have to do a little bit of work to figure out how to open and read from files for this task.

- If you enjoy these proofs, you can try some problems here: https://projecteuler.net/archives
    - Project Euler (Euler is pronounced 'oil-er') is a great thinking exercise, and a way to practice concepts you learn in discrete and algorithms.
